# Handoff

For an agent picking this up cold. Read this before touching anything. It is
about how to work on Causalis without breaking it, and what is currently true
about the part of it under active work.

## What this is

Causalis is a deterministic artificial-life god game. Chemistry becomes life,
life becomes culture, culture becomes history, and every flame, lineage, city
and war shares one conserved world. It is a Vite app deployed to GitHub Pages
at <https://luhreally.github.io/Causalis/>.

Three invariants hold everywhere and are not negotiable:

- **Render code never writes `W`.** Drawing reads the world; it never changes
  it. Several tests assert this by hashing the world across a render.
- **Matter is conserved.** Anything created by a player action is booked
  through `causalPushInput` so the audit balances. `auditMatter().delta` must
  stay 0.
- **The simulation is deterministic.** Same seed, same ticks, same world.

## How the code is laid out

`src/game/sections/*.js` are numbered sections composed, in the order given by
`src/game/manifest.json`, into **one shared closure**. That has two
consequences you must hold in your head:

- Later sections extend earlier ones by **override chains**:
  `const base = fn; fn = function (...) { ... base(...) ... }`. This is the
  idiom for changing behaviour. Add a new section rather than editing an old
  one where you can.
- **Duplicate top-level identifiers silently override each other.** Two
  sections declaring the same `const` is a real bug that no test may catch.
  There is a `dupscan.cjs` in the scratchpad for this.

Every system also carries a `window.ALIFE_*_DEBUG` surface. Use it. It is how
the tests and every probe reach inside the closure.

## Working rules — read these, they will save you an hour

**Never edit the source tree in `C:\Users\danie\OneDrive\Documents\Causal sim`.**
Windows Controlled Folder Access blocks writes there. It is a mirror used only
for deploying. Do all work in the clone:

```
/c/Users/danie/Causalis-work/repo        branch: visuals
```

**Run the fast suite before every commit and never edit source while it runs.**

```
npm run test:fast > log 2>&1
bash $SCRATCH/suite-check.sh log 93
```

The expected count is the number of `"ok": true` lines, currently **93**. It
changes only when you add a test file. A green suite is necessary and not
sufficient — see "Pitfalls".

**Deploy** by fast-forwarding the mirror and pushing:

```
cd "/c/Users/danie/OneDrive/Documents/Causal sim"
git fetch -q /c/Users/danie/Causalis-work/repo visuals
git merge -q --ff-only FETCH_HEAD
git push -q origin codex/graphics-finished:main
```

The Pages workflow finishes in about **30 seconds**, not minutes. Verify with
the API rather than guessing:

```
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/Luhreally/Causalis/actions/runs?per_page=3"
```

and confirm the change is really live by grepping the served bundle for a
marker the commit introduced. A test-only commit produces a byte-identical
bundle, so its asset hash will not change.

**Each change wants:** a numbered section or an override in one, a
`window.ALIFE_*_DEBUG` entry, a `tests/*-smoke.cjs` assertion chained into
`npm run test:fast`, and a README paragraph in the project's voice.

## Measuring

Balance work here cannot be judged by reading code. There is a probe toolkit in
the session scratchpad (`$SCRATCH`), each a small Node script that loads the
composed runtime in a VM and reaches into the closure:

| probe | what it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `skip-probe-lean.cjs <seed> <size> <complexity> <maxSkips>` | press Causal skip until a ship leaves; one JSON row per press |
| `lean-diag.cjs` | the same, plus deaths by cause, hunger, and famine per press |
| `lean-why.cjs` | per-town food, store, hungry share, fields, stores |
| `concert-check.cjs` | the concerted-effort level held vs currently needed, per decade |
| `haste-check.cjs` | histogram of the birth haste across everyone alive |
| `road-why.cjs` | who knows road building, town distances, why no link |
| `plain-run.cjs` | a world with no skips at all, as a control |
| `shot.cjs <out.png> "<setup js>" "" <url>` | headless Chrome against the live site; prints the setup's return value |

Run them with `SCRATCH` and `CAUSALIS_ROOT` set. **Set the environment per
command** — `cd x && export … && node a & node b &` leaves the second command
without either, which fails in a way that looks like an empty result.

A run to a launch takes 10–25 minutes of wall clock. Run several seeds in
parallel; the machine has 32 cores.

## Pitfalls that have actually bitten

- **A green smoke test is not evidence a change fires.** Twice a suite-clean,
  test-covered change turned out to be a no-op on generated worlds, because the
  fixture builds exactly the shape the assertion needs and real worlds fail the
  precondition. Probe a generated world and print the change's own return value
  before you believe it.
- **Bit-identical A/B rows mean the change did not fire**, not that the seed is
  deterministic. Diff the logs field by field before concluding anything.
- **The simulation is chaotic.** One seed's before/after is weak evidence in
  either direction. Judge across at least three seeds.
- **Verify patch anchors.** A heredoc patch whose assertion fails leaves the
  file untouched, and a commit can then ship only a README sentence describing
  code that does not exist. `grep -c` the new identifier after patching and
  check `git show --stat` before believing a commit.
- **Write files with `newline="\n"`** on Windows or a whole file rewrites as
  CRLF and `git diff --stat` shows thousands of changed lines.
- **`prettier` is not installed** in the work clone. Format by hand in its
  style.

## Where the work stands

The current push has been about the Causal skip: the player presses it, the
world runs toward the next milestone under a concerted effort, and eventually a
ship leaves for the stars. The goal is that a ship actually launches, on every
world size, including the ones a phone would pick.

Measured end to end, current `main`:

| world | result |
| --- | --- |
| standard 180×110 | not yet measured |
| small 120×72, `ship-b` | ship at year 86 |
| small 120×72, `ship-c` | ship at year 80 |
| small 120×72, `causal-origin` | no ship; starves from year 122 |
| phone 96×58 lean | ship at year 104 |
| battery 72×44 lean, `causal-origin` | ship at year 117 |
| battery 72×44 lean, `ship-b` | no ship; collapses |
| battery 72×44 lean, `ship-c` | no ship; blocked on a road, then collapses |

"Low battery mode" means two settings in the create-world form: the world size
`battery` (72×44) or `phone` (96×58), and `complexity: "lean"`.
`MOBILE_WORLD_DEFAULTS` in `44-mobile-runtime.js` is phone + lean + low quality
+ no labels. Lean only coarse-grains people more than five tiles from a
settlement, and compensates their stride, so townspeople behave identically —
it is not a factor in any of the above.

### What a modern world asks, and why it scales

A world only sends a ship once it looks like one that could: cities at the
urban stage, current in some towns, tower blocks, working factories, a road,
and people living in towns. Those counts were written for a standard map and
did not scale, while every other gate in the game does. They now all fall with
the map's **area** and hold at a floor that keeps each one's meaning.

| size | cities | current in | blocks | factories | people |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| battery | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 20 |
| phone | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 28 |
| small | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 44 |
| standard and above | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 100 |

The people floor is not a number of its own: it is two cities' worth at that
world's own urban gate (`urbanGate().local` from `84-horizons.js`). Read the
whole set with `window.ALIFE_MODERN_DEBUG.wants()`.

### Open problems, with what is already known

**1. Worlds overshoot and starve.** This is the big one and it is upstream of
almost everything else. `updateConcertedEffortState` in `41-implicit-society.js`
raises the concerted effort to level 2 whenever any settlement has
`settlementFood(s) < 8` **or `settlementWater(s) < 8`**. The water term pins it
on permanently, because towns simply do not stockpile water — measured on
causal-origin at year 60 with no skips, the largest town held **zero** stored
water while its food was abundant, and five to seven of eight towns sat under
the line across a 120-year run. `concertedIntensity()` is then 3, and
`concertedBirthHaste` returns 5, so every fed person's next child comes five
times faster, from the first decades, forever. Populations run past what the
fields carry and then starve.

Two attempts to curb it were measured and **both made things worse**:

- Feeding every *lean* town instead of two in *famine* (`ab8fa05`, reverted in
  `f06f3ae`): `ship-c` went from a ship at year 79 to halving at 145.
- Raising `HASTE_FOOD` in `82-granary.js` from `LEAN_FOOD * 2` to `* 4`:
  `ship-c` halved at year 70, down to nine people by the sixth press.

The lesson: **the fast growth is load-bearing.** It is what gets these worlds
to the modern gate at all. Do not tighten it without replacing the growth it
provides. Note also that `makeCausalSkipState` pins the level to at least 2 for
a skip's whole duration, so fixing the water trigger alone will not change
anything during skips.

**2. A one-town polity can never build a road.** `roadPassFor` in
`88-roads.js` returns immediately unless a faction has two or more towns, and
`chooseRoadPair` only pairs towns of the same faction. On `ship-c` battery at
year 98 there were four towns in four separate factions, one town each, and
only one of those factions knew road building. Every pair was a fine distance
apart (21–51 tiles, well inside `ROAD_LINK_REACH` of 64). The world stood one
requirement — a road — from launching, for ten presses, and could not build one
in principle. This looks like the most tractable remaining blocker.

**3. `causal-origin` on small regressed.** It shipped at year 104 before the
food work and now reaches the road and three tower blocks by year 135 before
halving. Two of three small seeds went the other way, so the net is positive,
but this seed wants its own diagnosis.

Commit messages here carry the measurement that justified the change, and the
ones that record a reverted experiment are as useful as the rest. Read them
before re-treading ground.

## House style

The README and the code comments are written in a particular voice: plain
words, concrete nouns, the reason before the mechanism. "The road got its stone,
and every town in famine now gets its bread the same way." Match it. Explain in
a comment *why* a thing is the way it is, especially when the reason is a
measurement, and put the number in.
